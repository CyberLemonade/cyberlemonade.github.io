      <p>
        Between 2015 and 2021, I was doing a fair amount of game development.
        My first games were console versions of Frogger and Pac-Man, coded in BASIC.
        Till 2020, I was writing everything from scratch in Java.
        I learnt various game-dev fundamentals such as 2.5D backgrounds, isometric rendering, procedural terrain generation, hosting multiplayer games on servers, using spritesheets for animations, and efficient collision detection algorithms.
        In 2021, I began coding in Unity and Unreal Engine.
        The same year, I collaboratively participated in a game jam at IIT Kanpur.

        I joined a Dungeons & Dragons campaign in 2020 and have been playing with the group ever since.
        Every now and then, I will run my own multi-shot to explore fantasy worldbuilding and storytelling techniques (usually follows a particularly inspiring novel that I just read).  
        I made a valiant effort to follow
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/criticalrole" target="_blank">Critical Role</a>'s
        live-play, specifically their third campaign, but retired hurt at around episode 69.
        They have some fantastic multi-shots, though, if you're wondering how D&D works -

        is one of my favourites.

        The same TTRPG group got me into board games as well.
        Some of my favourites are Splendor, Citadels, and Everdell, although I prefer card games over board games.
        They are sufficiently random, and the mechanics are familiar enough that one can reasonably play a competitive round even after just being introduced to a new game.
        That being said, I've been (unsuccessfully) looking for a group to play Bridge with for the past two years.
        <a href="https://www.pagat.com/alpha/" target="_blank">Here</a>
        is a great resource if you're looking to find a new card game to play.
