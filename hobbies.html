        When I'm not at work you will most likely find me walking.
        Sometimes not even to someplace.
        I just enjoy walking.
        And Boston's very walkable too.
        If you're looking for good walking routes in Boston, try the
        <a href="https://www.esplanade.org/" target="_blank">Charles River Esplanade</a>
        (great for when you need to cross the river),
        the
        <a href="https://www.emeraldnecklace.org/" target="_blank">Emerald Necklace</a>
        (this one ends at the
        <a href="https://arboretum.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Arnold Arboretum</a>,
        which one should see of its own accord),
        or the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Avenue_Mall" target="_blank">Commonwealth Avenue Mall</a>
        (for when you need to go downtown).
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my other favourite spots in Boston are
        <a href="https://brattlefilm.org/" target="_blank">The Brattle Theatre</a>
        (movie projection from behind the screen!),
        <a href="https://coolidge.org/" target="_blank">The Coolidge Corner Theatre</a>,
        any
        <a href="https://bbqchicken.com/" target="_blank">BBQ Chicken</a>
        outlet (except maybe the Allston one, I'm not a fan of Allston),
        <a href="https://mountauburn.org/" target="_blank">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a>,
        the
        <a href="https://www.mfa.org/" target="_blank">Boston MFA</a>,
        and the
        <a href="https://www.bostonharborwalk.com/" target="_blank">Harborwalk</a>
        (this one just because I think it's really cool to walk along the Atlantic coast).

      <p>
          If I'm not walking, I might be lifting weights or climbing, or more recently, kickboxing.
          Occasionally I will be playing football or badminton too but I'm not as regular at these as I used to be and would like to be.
          If you're looking to get into football and need a team to root for, join me and
          <a href="https://alexrider.com/" target="_blank">Alex Rider</a>
          in supporting
          <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/" target="_blank">Chelsea</a>
          if you like to see your team fight for it, or
          <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/" target="_blank">Real Madrid</a>
          if you enjoy consistently winning silverware.
          For tennis, pick
          <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/jannik-sinner/s0ag/overview" target="_blank">Jannik Sinner</a>
          or
          <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/carlos-alcaraz/a0e2/overview" target="_blank">Carlos Alcaraz</a>
          if you want your athlete to win anything ever.
          I do watch other sports as well but can't offer any useful advice on how to get into them.

      <p>
        When I'm tired, I'm probably at home reading a book.
        There's not really any overarching theme to the books I read, although if you squint hard enough, you might see a slight bias towards fantasy and historical fiction.
      </p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>
          A recent novel that I really like is

        When I'm not tired and it's the weekend, I'm almost definitely watching a movie.
        Similar to my bookshelf, my movie drawer has no coherent theme either,
        barring a mildly disproportionate number of animated flicks.
      </p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>
          Check out the oldest feature-length animated movie ever made --
          <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-adventures-of-prince-achmed/" target="_blank">The Adventures of Prince Achmed</a> (turns 100 in 2026).
        </li>
        <li>
          Check out the most iconic animated movie ever made --
          <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/akira/" target="_blank">Akira</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check out the most consistent franchise ever made --
          <a href="https://letterboxd.com/grg326/list/mission-impossible/" target="_blank">Mission Impossible</a>.
        </li>
        <li>

        I <em>can</em> come up with other recommendations as well, but I would want to tailor them to the listener's interests.
        And for the time being, my Letterboxd will not be featured on my webpage.

        I also love reading about visual effects in cinema, and you can check out
