      <p>
        Between 2015 and 2021, I was doing a fair amount of game development.
        My first games were console versions of Frogger and Pac-Man, coded in BASIC.
        Till 2020, I was writing everything from scratch in Java.
        I learnt various game-dev fundamentals such as 2.5D backgrounds, isometric rendering, procedural terrain generation, hosting multiplayer games on servers, using spritesheets for animations, and efficient collision detection algorithms.
        In 2021, I began coding in Unity and Unreal Engine.
        The same year, I collaboratively participated in a game jam at IIT Kanpur.

      <p>
        I joined a Dungeons & Dragons campaign in 2020 and have been playing with the group ever since.
        Every now and then, I will run my own multi-shot to explore fantasy worldbuilding and storytelling techniques (usually follows a particularly inspiring novel that I just read).  
        I made a valiant effort to follow
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/criticalrole" target="_blank">Critical Role</a>'s
        live-play, specifically their third campaign, but retired hurt at around episode 69.
        They have some fantastic multi-shots, though, if you're wondering how D&D works -
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxpS2Q_QbR0cPCLxnnP3VnEiKk3tmsQ4f" target="_blank">Exandria Unlimited: Calamity</a>
        is one of my favourites.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same TTRPG group got me into board games as well.
        Some of my favourites are Splendor, Citadels, and Everdell, although I prefer card games over board games.
        They are sufficiently random, and the mechanics are familiar enough that one can reasonably play a competitive round even after just being introduced to a new game.
        I've been (unsuccessfully) looking for a group to play Bridge with for the past two years.
        <a href="https://www.pagat.com/alpha/" target="_blank">Here</a>
        is a great resource if you're looking to find a new card game to play.

      <h6 class="docs-header">Sports</h6>

      <p>
        I love sports - both playing and watching.
        My favourite sports to play are football and badminton (also climbing, although it doesn't exactly qualify as a sport in my head).
        I used to play cricket and kho kho at one point, but I haven't in a while.
        I'm also learning martial arts, but that too doesn't qualify as a sport I think.
      </p>

      <p>
        I watch club football fairly regularly.
        I root for Chelsea and Real Madrid and am unapologetic in my support for them.
        I've seen Chelsea play at Stamford Bridge (January 20, 2025, vs. Wolves), which has been my crowning moment in life so far.
        I watch tennis Grand Slams.
        I used to root for Rafael Nadal, but now that he's retired, I still haven't picked a new favourite between Alcaraz and Sinner.
        I've been to the French Open twice (2023 and 2024), and shook hands with Alexander Zverev once (I dropped the ball that he signed and he picked it up and we ended up shaking hands).
        I also support India when they're playing cricket or competing at the Olympics and Commonwealth Games (we're pretty bad at football, so I don't get to back them in that).
      </p>

      <p>
        Occasionally, I will watch F1 (which is also not a real sport in my opinion).
        I think Max Verstappen is really cool and Lewis Hamilton is very drippy, that's about it.

    <div class="docs-section" id="books">
      <h6 class="docs-header">Books</h6>

      <p>
        I read novels with some frequency.
        By default, I will find myself a new fantasy novel unless a friend has an exciting new recommendation.
        Some of my favourite series from childhood are the Sally Lockhart mysteries, The Guardians of Ga'Hoole (they are the reason why owls are my favourite animal), and Alex Rider (he is the reason I support Chelsea).
        Some books that I've read more recently and loved are Master and Margarita, Babel, and After Dark.        
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't read non-fiction yet, unless mythology counts.
