      <p>
        When I'm not at work you will most likely find me walking.
        Sometimes not even to someplace.
        I just enjoy walking.
        And Boston's very walkable too.
        If you're looking for good walking routes in Boston, try the
        <a href="https://www.esplanade.org/" target="_blank">Charles River Esplanade</a>
        (great for when you need to cross the river), the
        <a href="https://www.emeraldnecklace.org/" target="_blank">Emerald Necklace</a>
        (ends at the
        <a href="https://arboretum.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Arnold Arboretum</a>,
        which one should see of its own accord), the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Avenue_Mall" target="_blank">Commonwealth Avenue Mall</a>
        (for when you need to go downtown), or
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pBqv9HE7jD4a7mT57">Beacon Street</a>
        (I live on this street and as far as ordinary residential streets go it's top 5).
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my other favourite spots in Boston are
        <a href="https://brattlefilm.org/" target="_blank">The Brattle Theatre</a>
        (movie projection from behind the screen!),
        <a href="https://coolidge.org/" target="_blank">The Coolidge Corner Theater</a>
        (oldest theatre in Boston), any
        <a href="https://bbqchicken.com/" target="_blank">BBQ Chicken</a>
        outlet (except maybe the Allston one, I'm not a fan of Allston),
        <a href="https://mountauburn.org/" target="_blank">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a>
        (Boston's response to
        <a href="https://parisjetaime.com/eng/culture/cimetiere-du-pere-lachaise-p1104" target="_blank">Père Lachaise</a>),
        the
        <a href="https://www.mfa.org/" target="_blank">Boston MFA</a>
        (they've got an original
        <a href="https://www.mfa.org/article/2021/dolls-house" target="_blank">Dutch dollhouse</a>
        from the 17th century, only three of these on display in the world right now), and the
        <a href="https://www.bostonharborwalk.com/" target="_blank">Harborwalk</a>
        (this one just because I think it's really cool to walk along the Atlantic coast).
        Any place I missed you'll find in a top 10 list for Boston.

        If I'm not walking, I might be lifting weights or climbing, or more recently, kickboxing.
        Occasionally I will be playing football or badminton too but I'm not as regular at these as I used to be and would like to be.
        If you're looking to get into football and need a team to root for, join me and

        in supporting
        <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/" target="_blank">Chelsea</a>
        if you like to see your team fight for it, or
        <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/" target="_blank">Real Madrid</a>
        if you enjoy consistently winning silverware.
        For tennis, pick

        if you want your athlete to win anything ever.
        I watch other sports as well but can't offer any useful advice on how to get into them.

        When I'm tired, I'm probably at home reading a book.
        There's not really any overarching theme to the books I read, although if you squint hard enough, you might see a slight bias towards fantasy and historical fiction.

        When I'm <em>not</em> tired and it's the weekend, I'm almost definitely watching a movie.
        Similar to my bookshelf, my movie drawer has no coherent theme barring a mildly disproportionate number of animated flicks.

      <p>
        On Sundays, a large portion of my wakeful hours will be spent playing board games.
        In the morning, I'll play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
        If you're curious about the kind of story that can be told through this medium, watch one of my favourite multishots —
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlIkkeWmVvA" target="_blank">Exandria Unlimited: Calamity</a>.
        In the evening, I'll be playing card games or Mahjong.
        <a href="https://www.pagat.com/alpha/" target="_blank">Here</a>
        is a great resource if you're looking for a new card game to play.
        I play other board games as well, but with no level of consistency.
